Features of Hooks: You can write stateful logic that you can reuse over 1,2..10..20 Components.

Built in hooks: 1. useState

Building Forms and how Hooks makes this easier:

useEffect:
instead of React lifeCycle Methods (componentDidMount(), componentDidUnmount(), componentDidUpdate()) we use useEffect inplace of all of the React LifeCycle Methods. useEffect runs after every render (It can be customized).
useEffect aslo replaces passing in a callback function to setState()
